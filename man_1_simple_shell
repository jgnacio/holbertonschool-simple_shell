.SH NAME
hsh - holberton simple shell, a simple UNIX command language interpreter


.SH DESCRIPTION
The hsh is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that executes commands read from standard input. The shell works in interactive and non interactive mode just as well. Examples of how both of these modes work are included in the USAGE section.

When a command is called on the hsh, the program will first check for it's existance in the current directory (or in the specified pathname). If a regular, executable file is found, the program will call the fork() syscall, and the newly created child process will call execve and execute the passed command on the child process, while the parent process waits for its completion. If a something else than a regular file is found (for example: a directory, or a symbolic link), the program will print to standard error that the passed command is not a regular file, and prompt the user for a new input.

If the command isn't an existing pathname and can't be found, the program will search for the command in all of the directories listed in the environment variable PATH. If a regular, executable file is found, just as before, the program calls fork() and executes the command in the shild process while the parent waits for completion. If a non regular file is found, the program will print an according message to standard error, and prompt the user for a new input.

Some of the commands do not call execve and instead are built-ins. Examples of this are: the env command, which prints out the environment (same as printenv) and the exit [status] which exits the shell with an exit status inseted by the user, or 0 if no exit status is specified.

To exit the shell, two main options are available: (1) type exit (+ Carriage Return) once prompted for an input, or (2) type Ctrl + D, which signifies an End of File (EOF). If exit [status], status must be a positive int (numbers beyond 255 are accepted, but the program will perform [% 256] to the number recieved), otherwise an error message will be displayed and the shell won't exit. The shell is case sensitive, but any spaces or tabs inserted before or after the typed command won't be registered. The Ctrl + C input from the user terminates a child process if one is executing, but it won't exit the shell.



.SH INSTALLATION
To run the hsh on your console, simply clone or fork the repository. The Makefile in the repository contains the recommened compiler and flags used in compilation. To compile the program, simply type make in the command line. Once compiled, the shell can be run in interactive mode by running ./hsh, or non interactively by running: `echo "command" | ./hsh`. If additional scrutiny is desired, the command make run will run the created executable with valgrind to detect memory leaks and aditional errors.


.SH FILES USED AND CONTENTS
.SH Source files

.IP simple_shell.c
Runs the hsh program

.IP get_path.c
Functions used to obtain the PATH from the environment, to search for the commands passed in those directories

.IP strings.c
String functions used, execpt srttok, which is taken from the <string.h> library.

.IP check_existance.c
Function used to verify the passed filename corresponds to an executable, regular file.

.IP env.c
Creates the env built-in.

.IP aux_functions.c
Auxilliary functions used. Principally to free multiple variables, to tokenize a string, and to manage the Ctrl C (SIGINT) signal.

.IP built-in.c
Function to implement different built ins in a conscice manner. Used in simple_shell.c


.SH Heders
.IP main.h
Main header for the hsh project. Contains all structures used and most function prototypes

.IP strings.h
Contains the prototypes of string functions used in the project (except strtok)


.SH Other
.IP man_1_simple_shell
Manual page for the hsh. Usage: man ./man_1_simple_shell

.IP AUTHORS
Contains information on all contributors to the project.

.IP Makefile
Contains a makefile, for easy compilation and for running on interactive mode with memche

.IP Backup
Directory for backup files and functions for future additions to the project. Include drafts for our own version of getline, strtok and functions to create and free linked lists.


.SH NOTES ON COMPILATION
In testing, all files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -g. These flags are present in the Makefile.


.SH USAGE AND EXAMPLES


.SH Interactive mode
 
 # ./hsh
 $ qwerty
 ./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
 $ pwd
 /holbertonschool-simple_shell
 $ which ls
 /usr/bin/ls
 $ ls
 env-main.c  exec.c  fork.c  pid.c  ppid.c    prompt   prompt.c  shell.c  stat.c
 $ exit 98
 # echo $?
 98

.SH Non-interactive mode
 
 # echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
 ./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
 # echo "pwd" | ./hsh
 /holbertonschool-simple_shell
 # echo "which ls" | ././hsh
 /usr/bin/ls
 # echo "ls" | ./hsh
 env-main.c  exec.c  fork.c  pid.c  ppid.c    prompt   prompt.c  shell.c  stat.c


.SH UNAVAILABLE OPTIONS
Unlike the sh shell, or more advanced shells (like ash, zsh or bash), the hsh doesn't support pipes, special characters (like wildcards, $$ or $?), I/O redirection and other advanced features. The hsh can't recieve it's input from other files, and doesn't accept the options that the regular sh does (such as -c or -s, for example). In practice, optional arguments can be passed when running hsh, but they will be ignores.
